Level 1:	Level 2:	Level 3:

A 5		AB 2		ACD 2
B 3		AC 2
C 3		AD 3
D 4		BC 1 x
E 1 x		BD 1 x
F 1 x		CD 3

(a) support of AD: 3 
(b) number of level 2 candidates: 6 
(c) number of level 3 candidates: 1 
(d) number of frequent item sets: 9

Q2 Aclose

Level 1:	Level 2:

A 2		AB 2 x
B 4		AC 2 x
C 5		AD 0 x
D 3		BC 4 x
E 1 x		BD 2
		CD 3 x

Generator	Closure
A		ABC
B		BC
C		C
D		CD
BD		BCD


(a) number of level 2 candidates: 6
(b) number of level 3 candidates: 0
(c) number of generators: 5 
(d) number of closed frequent item sets: 5 

Q3 GSP

Candidates and their support (x = infrequent)

Level 1:	Level 2:	Level 3:

R 5		RR 3		RRR 0 x
O 5		RO 4		RRO 0 x
C 2 x		RK 3		RRK 1 x
K 4		OO 0 x		ROR 3
Y 2 x		OR 4		ROK 3
		OK 4		RKR 2
		KK 0 x		ORR 0 x
		KR 3		ORK 1 x
		KO 0 x		OKR 3
				KRR 0 x

There are no level 4 candidates: every pre-candidate has an infrequent subsequence.

(a) Number of level 2 candidates: 9
(b) Number of level 3 candidates: 10
(c) Number of level 4 candidates: 0
(d) Number of frequent sequences: 12

Q4 Trees

The first column of the table below lists the node numbers in T1; each subsequent column gives a different mapping by giving
the node numbers in T2 to which the nodes of T1 are mapped. Only the first mapping corresponds to an induced subtree.
As usual, the nodes are numbered according to depth-first pre-order traversal of the tree.

1: 1 1 1 1 1
2: 2 3 2 3 6
3: 5 5 8 8 8

(a) Induced subtrees: 1
(b) Embedded subtrees: 5
